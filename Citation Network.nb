The difference between the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]lite_network\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]baby_network\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is that in the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]lite\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] one I commented out info for URL, hash, citation, \
type, includesAlg, and verified (basically, all the longer strings except the \
title, and verified as well since it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not necessary). Maybe \
also type and includesAlg? Since they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll only exist for very \
few of them. Since it makes it take waaaaaaaay longer. This way we should be \
able to see if the floats make it worse.\
